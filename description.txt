description: principal component analysis (PCA) can be used to reduce the dimensions of the matrix (image) and project those new dimensions to reform the image that retains its qualities but is smaller in k-weight. You can choose 100 images from single class from the following dataset, and employ PCA to compress the images. In the final report, please illustrate the performance of image compression, such as reconstruction error, space saving, compressing rate, and case study, etc.
